## üöÄ&nbsp; Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Kubernetes 1.27+
* Carvel [`kctrl`](https://carvel.dev/kapp-controller/docs/latest/install/#installing-kapp-controller-cli-kctrl) CLI.
* Carvel [kapp-controller](https://carvel.dev/kapp-controller) deployed in your Kubernetes cluster. You can install it with Carvel [`kapp`](https://carvel.dev/kapp/docs/latest/install) (recommended choice) or `kubectl`.

  ```shell
  kapp deploy -a kapp-controller -y \
    -f https://github.com/carvel-dev/kapp-controller/releases/latest/download/release.yml
  ```

### Installation

Install the Kadras package repository in a dedicated namespace using `kctrl`:

  ```shell
  kctrl package repository add -r kadras-packages \
    --url ghcr.io/kadras-io/kadras-packages \
    -n kadras-system --create-namespace
  ```

<details><summary>Installation via CRDs</summary>
Instead of installing the Kadras package repository with `kctrl`, you can apply the necessary Carvel CRDs directly using [`kapp`](https://carvel.dev/kapp/docs/latest/install), `kubectl` or a GitOps operator.

  ```shell
  kubectl create namespace kadras-system
  kapp deploy -a kadras-repo -n kadras-system -y \
    -f https://github.com/kadras-io/kadras-packages/releases/latest/download/package-repository.yml
  ```
</details>

Verify the list of available Carvel package repositories and their status.

  ```shell
  kctrl package repository list -n kadras-system
  ```

List all the Carvel packages available in the Kadras package repository.

  ```shell
  kctrl package available list -n kadras-system
  ```
