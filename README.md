## Prerequisites

* Kubernetes 1.24+
* Carvel [`kctrl`](https://carvel.dev/kapp-controller/docs/latest/install/#installing-kapp-controller-cli-kctrl) CLI.
* Carvel [kapp-controller](https://carvel.dev/kapp-controller) deployed in your Kubernetes cluster. You can install it with Carvel [`kapp`](https://carvel.dev/kapp/docs/latest/install) (recommended choice) or `kubectl`.

  ```shell
  kapp deploy -a kapp-controller -y \
    -f https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-kapp-controller/releases/latest/download/release.yml
  ```

## Installation

You can install the Kadras package repository in a dedicated namespace using `kctrl`:

    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace kadras-packages
    kctrl package repository add -r kadras-repo \
        --url ghcr.io/kadras-io/kadras-packages:0.7.3 \
        -n kadras-packages
    ```

### Verification

You can verify the list of available Carvel package repositories and their status.

  ```shell
  kctrl package repository list -n kadras-packages
  ```

### Packages

The Kadras package repository provides a collection of Carvel packages that you can list.

    ```shell
    kctrl package available list -p kpack.packages.kadras.io -n kadras-packages
    ```

## Upgrading

You can upgrade an existing repository to a newer version using `kctrl`.

  ```shell
  kctrl package repository update -r kadras-repo \
    --url ghcr.io/kadras-io/kadras-packages:<new-version> \
    -n kadras-packages
  ```

## Other

Instead of installing the Kadras package repository with `kctrl`, you can apply the necessary Carvel `PackageMetadata` and `Package` resources directly using [`kapp`](https://carvel.dev/kapp/docs/latest/install) or `kubectl`.

  ```shell
  kubectl create namespace kadras-packages
  kapp deploy -a kadras-repo -n kadras-packages -y \
    -f https://github.com/kadras-io/kadras-packages/releases/latest/download/package-repository.yml
  ```
